Given datasets are:	
  -Enrolment Data
  -Demographic Update Data
  -Biometric Update Data

1. Enrolment dataset details
 This dataset provides aggregated information on Aadhaar enrolments across various demographic and geographic levels.
  -Starts on 2-03-2025 till 31-12-2025
  -Contains 3 csv files named api_data_aadhar_enrolment_0_500000.csv, api_data_aadhar_enrolment_500000_1000000.csv, api_data_aadhar_enrolment_1000000_1006029.csv
  -Rows: Number of rows mentioned in the title
  -Columns(7): date (date of enrollment), state, district, pincode, age_0_5, age_5_18, age_18_greater

  -Understanding: 
    India uses a 6-digit PIN (Postal Index Number) system to identify postal regions and post offices.
    The first digit indicates the postal zone.
    1–8 → Civilian geographical zones of India
    9 → Army Postal Service (APS)
    Army PIN codes always start with 9 and are assigned to military units, not geographic locations.
    The first 2 digits represent the postal circle / sub-region.
    The first 3 digits identify the sorting district.
    The last 3 digits specify the individual post office.
    India currently has ~19,000 active PIN codes, while the system allows up to 1,000,000 possible combinations, so it is highly scalable
