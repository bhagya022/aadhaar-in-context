Day-1 (14/1/25)
UIDAI Datasets analysis

Background Analysis:
UIDAI is the Unique Identification Authority of India. They issue aadhar which has an unique identification number.
-Issuing of the first UID was on September 2010. 

Aadhaar Number generation:
-Aadhaar is a random number that never starts with a 0 or 1
-Aadhar UID is Unique Identification Number xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
-Aadhaar first 11 numbers are random but the last number is generated using Verhoeff 
 Algorithm for typing mistakes and fake numbers.
-Aadhaar data is kept in about 7,000 servers in Bengaluru and Manesar.
-The major advantage is that all this can be taken care of by simply producing a citizen   
  identity card as proof of individual identity.
-In 2020, UIDAI introduced a new physical Aadhaar card made of PVC with additional 
 security features such as holograms, micro text, ghost images, guilloché Patterns, 
 invisible logos etc.
-Not limited to citizens - any resident of India (≥182 days in past 12 months) can get it

Criticism:
1. Privacy & Data Protection- Aadhaar stores sensitive data; India had no strong privacy law for years.
2. Security breaches & data leaks: Repeated leaks from government/agency portals
3. Mandatory use vs Supreme Court limits
4 . Exclusion from Welfare due to Authentication Failures- Fingerprints fail, Network outages block food rations & NREGA wages
5. Linking with Other Databases: Data leakages

Population of India
	Current population is 1.47 billion by 2050 it is expected to be 1.67 billion
